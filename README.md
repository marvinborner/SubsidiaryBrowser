# Subsidiary-browser

There are many dystopian companies like Disney and Nestl√© with hundreds of subsidiaries and sub-companies - use [this](https://marvinborner.github.io/SubsidiaryBrowser/index.html) tool to analyse them and never buy anything from them again (to prevent big tech monopoly-like companies)!

## "Offline" use
To use the tool without a working connection to WikiData servers, I implemented a debug flag in the code which enables the use of a local mirror of the responses.
